                    React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                    <span class="article__text--teg">
                        &lt;Text&gt;Hello,

                    </span>

                    <u>
                        a comprehensive guide to JSX
                    </u>
                    you can refer to

                    even
                    more.
                    Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for
                    the
                    cat, name,
                    and

                    <span class="article__text--teg">
                        &lt;Text&gt;.

                    </strong>
                    While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
                    like
                    a
                    component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or
                    that
                    comes
                    from
